# Mouseholder
This file includes 3-D printer files for custom mouse holders for lean (< 35g) and obese (up to 55g) mice 

The 3MF files within each folder can be used to print multiple parts simultaneously.  Each holder is composed of 4 printed parts.  The gate is made up of an assembly of the gate bolt, gate handle, and gate.  The chamber is the 4th part.  The holder also includes 3 parts that can be purchased at your local hardware store.  3 parts from hardware store include 1)  Compression Spring 3/4" Length, 7/16" O.D., 0.047" Wastegate, 2) Pan Head, Phillips, Machine Screw 8-32 X 1.5", 3) 8-32 nut (fits with screw, part 2)

To assemble 1) put machine screw into gate_bolt, 2) put spring over gate_bolt, 3) Put gate handle onto gate bolt, 4) put nut in gate, 5) using a Phillps head screwdriver, screw machine screw in gate bolt into nut in gate (continue screwing until it is tight), 6) put gate assembly into chamber.  For most uses you will want the extension on the gate handle to face the mouse.  This prevents the mouse from turning to look out the opening at the top.  However, we flip the gate when dealing with cannulated mice.  

Directions for Assembly and Use contains pictures that accompany these directions.
